## Post Compromise Attack Strategy
- We have an account, now what?
- Search the quick wins <br/>
   → Kerberoasting <br/>
   → Secretsdump <br/>
   → Pass the hash/ Pass the password <br/>
- No quick wins? Dig deep!  <br/>
   → Enumerate (Bloodhound, etc.) <br/>
   → Where does your account have access? <br/>
   → Old vulnerabilities die hard <br/>
- Think outside the box
