Active directory is an Identity management service. <br/>
It authenticates using Kerberos ticket.

## Active Directory Components <br/>
Composed of both physical and logical  components. <br/>
### Physical Components <br/>
- **Data Store/ AD DS Data Store** <br/>
	The AD DS data store contains the database fiels and processes that store and manage directory informatino for users, services, and applications. <br/>
		- Consists of the Ntds.dit file <br/>
		- Is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all domain controllers <br/>
		- Is accessible only through the domain controller processes andd protocols <br/>
		
- **Domain Controller** <br/>
	It is a server with the AD DS server role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller. <br/>
		- Host a copy of the AD DS directory store <br/> 
		- Provide authentication and authorization services <br/>
		- Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest <br/>
		- Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources <br/>
		
- **Global Catalog Server** <br/>
- **Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)** <br/>

### Logical Componenets
- **Partitions** 

- **Schema/ AD DS Schema** <br/>
   → Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory <br/>
   → Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration <br/>
     		
| Object Types | Function | Examples |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Class Object | What objects can be created in the directory | User, Computer |
| Attribute Object | Information that can be attached to an object | Display Name |

- **Domains** <br/>
	Domains are used to group and manage objects in an organization <br/>
      ⇒ An administrative boundary for applying policies to group of objects <br/>
      ⇒ A replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers <br/>
      ⇒ An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources <br/>
       
- **Domain Trees** <br/>
	A domain tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS.  <br/>
	All domains in the tree: <br/>
      ⇒ Share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain <br/>
      ⇒ Can have additional child domains <br/>
      ⇒ By default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains <br/>
     
- **Forests** <br/>
	It is a collection of one or more domain trees <br/>
      ⇒ Share a common schema <br/>
      ⇒ Share a common configuration partition <br/>
      ⇒ Share a common global catalog to enable searching <br/>
      ⇒ Enable trusts between all  domains in the forest <br/>
      ⇒ Share the Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups   <br/>

- **Sites**

- **Organization Units (OUs)** <br/>
	OUs are Active Directory containers that can contains users, groups, computers, and other OUs.  <br/>
	OUs are used to: <br/>
      ⇒ Represent your ogranization hierarchically and logically <br/>
      ⇒ Manage a collection of objects in a consistent way <br/>
      ⇒ Delegate permissisons to administer groups of objects <br/>
      ⇒ Apply policies <br/>
   
- **Trusts**  <br/>
	Trusts provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain <br/>
	
| Types of Trusts | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Directional | The trust direction flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain |
| Transitive | The trust relationship is extended beyond a two domain trust to include other trusted domains |

	- All domains in a forest trust all other domains in the forest
	- Trust can extend outside the forest

- **Objects** <br/>
	
| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| User | Enables network resource access for a user |
| InetOrgPerson | Similar to a user account, Used for compatibility with other directory services |
| Contacts | Used primarily to assign e-mail addresses to external users, Does not enable network access |
| Groups | Used to simplify the administration of access control |
| Computers | Enables authentication and auditing of computer access to resources |
| Printers | Used to simplify the process of locating and connecting to printers |
| Shared folders | Enables users to search for shared folders based on properties |
