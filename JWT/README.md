# JSON Web Token (JWT)
** exploit.py: Python3 code to sign jwt using self generated RSA Key ** <br/>
- Signature can be cracked if the secret used for signature is weak. <br/>
Using hashcat, (Command: hashcat -m 16500 jwt.txt rockyou.txt) <br/>

- "none" algorithm can be used without providing signature
- If the token uses RS256 and we find a public key we can change the algorithm to HS256 and use public key to sign the token. (Can write exploit in python to create a new signature using public key)
- If the header in token contains "kid" field, it can be vulnerable to SQL Injection, directory traversals, etc. if proper escaping is not implemented
"kid" retrives a key from file system, database. This is done prior to the verification of the signature. Therefore, if the parameter is injectable you can bypass the signature. <br/>
In case of directory traversal, (/dev/null) can be used to bypass the signature as it returns null value. (Exploit can be written in python to sign the token with null value "" as a key) <br/>
In case of SQL Injection, "kid":"key' union select 1 --" can be used to bypass the signature as it returns 1. (Exploit can be written in python to sign the token with key as 1)
