# Authentication Bypass
- Adding spaces while registering as a user could bypass authentication. <br/>
&emsp; Eg: admin & admin[space] are equal. (Multiple Spaces can be used if single space is already used)
- Case Sensitive: Application processes "admin" and "AdmiN" differently but database can be case-insensitive and think they are same (Try while registering)<br/>
