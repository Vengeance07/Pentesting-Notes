# OAuth2

# SAML
- If SAML is used to provide Single Sign-On (SSO), check SAML Response and decode the encoded long text and modify the <NameID ...> value and then encode it again finally forward the request. If the signature is not validated in the server the authentication can be bypassed. <br/>
- If signature is validated in the server and shows the error "signature not valid", then try removing signature value from the SAML Response and send the request. <br/>
- SAML Comment Injection: Try registering user with email "admin<!--a-->@libcurl.so" (Trying to login as admin). When SAML login is executed it removes the comment part of the email and will login as admin@libcurl.so <br/>
